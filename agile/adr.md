# Architecture Decision Records

[Based on this article](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

## Why use them?

Agile methods are opposed to _useless_ documentation. Nobody reads long documentation. Ever. Big docs are also hard to maintain and become outdated quick.

We still want to track motivation between certain decisions

> Why were they thinging? Why they've used Tailwind instaed of plain CSS?!
> Redux? For storing just a few pieces of data!
> Surely if they've used `<insert edgy new framework>` the app wouldn't load for so long

This is especially important when the team changes over time (developers join and leave a project).

### Consequences of not using ADRs

Withount understanding the basis of decistion when we can either:

- Blindly accept it
  - > Ah yes, they've used that state management library so we should continue using it
  - ⚠️ our context for making this decision could have changed and therefore the decision _might_ not be valid anymore
- Blindly change it
  - > No, this is stupid. We should rewrite everything to use Tailwind CSS
  - Without understanding motivation for the decision we might undermine project's overall value
  - ]

## What is ADR

It's a record of "architecturally significant" decision

> Example: those which affect structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, construction techniques

It's simmilar in format to #Alexandrian_Patterns

> Note: the decision is not a pattern but they share the fact that they both "balance opposing forces" and "one can lead to another"

They're kept in project's repository, each file has a numer (ex. `docs/adr/adr-NNN.md`).
ADR uses simple formatting language like Markdown.
ADR's are numbered sequentially and monotonically [^1]. Numbers are **not** reused.

If we reverse decision we still keep the old one, but just mark it as **superseded**

> We want to know that it was **a** decistion, but it's no longer **the** decision

## How does it look like

It consists of title, status, context, decision, consequences

### Title

Title has the number, and describes the problem in short noun phrases [^2].

> Example:
> ADR 2: Deployment on Node 12
> ADR 9: OAauth Integration
> ADR 3: Webpack 5 Support

### Status

The current status of the proposal

- **proposed** - stakeholders haven't agreed yet
- **accepted** - everyone agrees, the decision was made

Later changes:

- **deprecated** / **superseded** - the decision was reversed, we've linked to the new ADR

### Context

This section describes "the forces" - technological, political, social, project specific. They are probably fighting over each other.

Language in this section should be neutral (we dont't want to get emotional), it simply states facts.

> Example [from adr-tool](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/blob/master/doc/adr/0002-implement-as-shell-scripts.md)
> ADRs are plain text files stored in a subdirectory of the project.
> The tool needs to create new files and apply small edits to the Status section of existing files.

### Decision

This section describes our response to "the forces".

It uses full sentences, with active voice [^3] - "We will..."

> Example [from adr-tool](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/blob/master/doc/adr/0008-use-iso-8601-format-for-dates.md)
>
> `adr-tools` will use the ISO 8601 format for dates: yyyy-mm-dd

### Consequences

Here describe context of what will happen after we'll apply the changes.

Every consequence should be listed, the good ones **and** the bad ones. A decision might have both positive, negative and neutral consequences - all should be listed here.

> Example [from adr-tool](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/blob/master/doc/adr/0008-use-iso-8601-format-for-dates.md)
> Dates are displayed in a standard, culture-neutral format.
> The UK-style and ISO 8601 formats can be distinguished by their separator character. The UK-style dates used a slash (/), while the ISO dates use a hyphen (-).
> Prior to this decision, adr-tools was deployed using the UK format for dates. After adopting the ISO 8601 format, existing deployments of adr-tools must do one of the following:
>
> - Accept mixed formatting of dates within their documentation library.
> - Update existing documents to use ISO 8601 dates by running adr upgrade-repository

## Resources

[adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) - CLI tool for working with ADRs in a project

[^1]: numbers are either only increasing or only decreasing
[^2]: noun phrase - a group of words that function as nouns (PL - rzeczownik), for example: _the building on a corner_. In ADRs we want jut the noun phrases without modifiers like _dull_, _new_, _easy_, etc. [Read more about noun phrases](https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/nouns/noun-phrases.html)
[^3]: Active voice (ex. my mom cooked a frog) as opposed to passive voice (ex. a frog was cooked by my mom)
