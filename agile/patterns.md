> [A] pattern is a three-part rule, which express a relation between a certain context, a problem, and a solution.

Pattern is a colution in a context

```
Pattern 1:
    Context: Mud Hut
    Problem: Allow natural light into the building
    Solution: Make an opening in the wall

Pattern 2:
    Context: Skyscraper
    Problem: Allow natural light into the building
    Solution: Make an opening in the wall
```

Two problems lead to same solutions, however the context is different. This different context can lead to other solutions when another problem appears (ex. prevent wind from entering)...

> In this example:
> Mud Hut - just put some leaves
> Skyscraper - put windows

Patterns are like words in a language that can be used to describe more general solution.

### More about patterns

- Patterns are abstract solutions to a problem in a context
  - they capture implicit knowledge of experts
  - patterns documented in a systemic way are a **Pattern Catalog**
- Patterns are concepts
  - they are not neutral observations
  - they solve specific problems
  - they present a geniuen problem and a plausible actions to solve it
  - they expose unbalanced forces that create problem
- Patterns are based on proven ideas; though the solution is not immediately obvious
  - they are like hueristics - they guide us when dealing with complex system
- Patterns address complex issues
  - they cannot be mindlessly copied
- Patterns are the building blocks of a true language
  - this _Pattern Language_ has its own vocabulary, syntax, gramar, taxonomy,
  - it's a network of interconnected patterns
- Patterns have a context
  - they don't exist in a vacuum
- Patterns are reusable
  - when patterns are applied the results are never the same
